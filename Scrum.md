#### **1. Introduction to Scrum**

- **Scrum**: The most popular agile development methodology. It provides a ==framework== for agile project organization and planning but does not mandate specific technical practices.

#### **2. Scrum Framework**

- **Scrum Team**: A cross-functional, self-organizing team responsible for delivering a potentially shippable product increment every sprint.
    
    - **Roles**:
        
        - **Product Owner (PO)**: Responsible for maximizing the value of the product by managing the product backlog and ensuring the team focuses on the right work.
        - **Scrum Master**: Acts as a coach, guiding the team in effective Scrum practices. Not a traditional project manager.
        - **Development Team**: A small group (typically ≤ 8 people) responsible for developing the product increment.
    
	- **Self-Organizing**: Teams decide how to organize their work, fostering collaboration and adaptability.

- **Scrum Pillars**:

- **Scrum Values**:
    
    - **Commitment**: Team members commit to achieving their goals.
    - **Courage**: Team members have the courage to do the right thing and tackle tough problems.
    - **Focus**: The team focuses on the work of the sprint to make the best progress toward the sprint goal.
    - **Openness**: The team and stakeholders are open about the work and challenges.
    - **Respect**: Team members respect each other as capable, independent individuals.

- **Scrum Events**
	- **Sprint**: A time-boxed period (≤ 1 month) during which a usable product increment is developed.
	    
	    - **Sprint Planning**: At the start of the sprint, the team plans the work to be done, sets the sprint goal, and creates the sprint backlog.
	    - **Daily Scrum**: A short daily meeting where team members discuss progress, problems, and plans for the day.
	    - **Sprint Review**: At the end of the sprint, the team demonstrates the increment to stakeholders and discusses progress.
	    - **Sprint Retrospective**: A meeting where the team reflects on the sprint and identifies improvements for the next sprint.

- **Scrum Artifacts**

	- **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of all work items (PBIs - Product Backlog Items) needed to complete the product. It includes features, user requests, development activities, and engineering improvements.
	    
	    - **Product Backlog Item States**:
	        - **Ready for Consideration**: High-level ideas that may change.
	        - **Ready for Refinement**: Important items that need further detail.
	        - **Ready for Implementation**: Detailed items ready for development.
	
	- **Sprint Backlog**: A subset of the product backlog selected for the current sprint. It includes the sprint goal, selected PBIs, and an actionable plan for delivering the increment.
	
	- **Increment**: The sum of all completed PBIs at the end of a sprint. It must be usable and meet the **Definition of Done**.

#### **3. Product Backlog Activities**

- **Creation**: New items are added to the backlog.
- **Refinement**: PBIs are analyzed and detailed to prepare them for implementation.
- **Estimation**: The team estimates the effort required for each PBI using metrics like ==**story points** or **person-hours**.==
- **Prioritization**: The product backlog is reordered based on new information and changing circumstances.

#### **4. Benefits of Timeboxed Sprints**

- **Demonstrable Progress**: Each sprint produces a tangible output.
- **Problem Discovery**: Errors are discovered early, limiting rework to the sprint duration.
- **Work Planning**: The team learns how much work they can complete in a fixed time.

#### **5. Additional Scrum Practices (Optional)**

- **Test Automation**: Automated tests ensure consistent quality and reduce manual testing effort.
- **Continuous Integration**: Code changes are integrated and tested frequently to catch integration issues early.
- **Code Completeness Checklist**: Ensures code is reviewed, unit-tested, integrated, and accepted before being considered complete.

#### **6. Managing External Interactions**

- **Team-Focused Interactions**: Handled by the Scrum Master (e.g., resolving impediments).
- **Product-Focused Interactions**: Handled by the Product Owner (e.g., managing the product backlog).

#### **7. Project Management in Scrum**

- **Scrum Master’s Role**: While not a traditional project manager, the Scrum Master may take on project management responsibilities in some organizations.
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Reporting progress to management.
    - Managing budgets, schedules, and risks.
    - Handling administrative tasks like hiring and compliance.
