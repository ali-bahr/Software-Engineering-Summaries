#### **1. Software Products Overview**

- **Definition**: Software products are ==generic systems designed to provide functionality useful to a wide range of customers==. Examples include large-scale business systems (e.g., MS Excel), personal products (e.g., Evernote), and mobile apps/games (e.g., Sudoku).

- **Evolution**: Software product engineering has evolved from custom software development techniques.

- **Custom Software**: Developed for specific clients (e.g., large businesses, governments). It has a long lifetime (10+ years) and must be supported over that period.
	- **starting point for software development**:  a set of software requirements.	
    - **Key Features**:
        - Requirements are owned by an external client.
        - The software company (contractor) designs and implements the system.
        - Requirements may change during development.

- **Product Software**: Developed to exploit a business opportunity. The company decides on features, development timeline, and product changes.
	- **starting point for product development**:  a business opportunity	
    - **Key Features**:
        - Rapid delivery is essential to capture the market.
        - No external customer generates requirements.


#### **2. Software Product Lines and Platforms**

- **Software Product Line**: A set of products sharing a common core, with customer-specific adaptations. Used when generic products cannot meet specific needs.

- **Platform**: A software/hardware product that allows new applications to be built on it (e.g., Facebook, which supports creating Facebook apps).


#### **3. Software Execution Models**

- **Stand-alone**: Software runs entirely on the customer’s computers.
- **Hybrid**: Part of the software runs on the customer’s computer, and part runs on the developer’s servers.
- **Software Service**: All features are implemented on the developer’s servers, accessed via a browser or mobile app.

#### **4. Product Vision**

- **Definition**: A simple statement defining the essence of the product.
- **Key Questions**: product vision must answer the following questions  		
    - What is the product?
    - Who are the target customers/users?
    - Why should customers buy it?
    
- **Moore’s Vision Template**:
    
    - FOR (target customer)    
    - WHO (statement of need/opportunity)
    - THE (product name) is a (product category)
    - THAT (key benefit)
    - UNLIKE (primary competitive alternative)
    - OUR PRODUCT (primary differentiation)
    
- **Information Sources for Product Vision**:
	
	- **Domain Experience**: Developers’ expertise in a specific area.   
	- **Product Experience**: Users’ insights into existing software.
	- **Customer Experience**: Discussions with prospective customers.
	- **Prototyping**: Experimenting with ideas using a prototype.

#### **5. Software Product Management**
- **Product Managers (PMs)**: Responsible for ==planning, development, and marketing of software products==.
    
    - **Key Responsibilities**:
        - Product vision management.
        - Product roadmap development.            
        - User story and scenario development.
        - Product backlog creation and management.
        - Acceptance and customer testing.

- **Product Management Concerns**:
    - Business needs.
    - Technology constraints.
    - Customer experience.
#### **6. Product Prototyping**

- **Purpose**: To test ideas and demonstrate market potential.
- **Two-Stage Prototyping**:
    - **Feasibility Demonstration**: Shows if the product ideas work.
    - **Customer Demonstration**: Extends the prototype with customer-specific features.
- **Key Point**: Always plan to throw away the prototype and re-implement the software with improvements.
